# A tool to monitor internet speeds and record them

## to do
* <strike>monitor internet speed and write to a csv fille</strike>
* write some analytics to return highest, average and lowest speeds
* <strike> write a way to turn this into a graph</strike>
* <strike> automate an upload of these files daily to a cloud storage system</strike>


## key learning points
1. use of matplotlib
2. environments and environment variables
3. pydrive and automated file uploads
4. benefits of a simple CSV over a database
5. my internet is pretty inconsistent

## installation
```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt
touch client_secrets.json (and get credentials from google drive)
```
